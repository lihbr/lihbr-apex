I've started to learn Rust for real. It's exciting to pick up a new language!

I'm looking forward to being able to do a few things with it, notably:
1. I've heard it's cool to make CLIs with it, designing great CLI experiences is interesting to me
2. I also know it can compile to WebAssembly, which I could then use on web-related projects

You can follow some of my progress, and uneducated rants (I'm French, do I get a pass?), by looking through the *links to this note* -^
